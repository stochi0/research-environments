SciCode is a research-grade scientific code-generation benchmark across 16 natural science subfields. Each problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems requiring reasoning, coding, and integration.

### Overview
- **Environment ID**: `scicode`
- **Short description**: Scicode evaluation environment

### Datasets
- **Primary dataset(s)**: `scicode-bench/SciCode`
- **Source links**: [Paper (arXiv:2407.13168)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13168) · [HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scicode-bench/SciCode)
- **Split sizes**: 80 examples (consisting of 340 subproblems)

### Quickstart
Run an evaluation with default settings:

```bash
prime eval run scicode
```

### Environment Arguments
| Arg | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `with_background` | bool | `True` | Whether to include step background text in the prompts |
| `timeout_per_test` | int | `120` | Maximum execution time (in seconds) for each test |
| `system_message` | str | `None` | System message to use for the environment |

### Metrics
| Metric | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `subproblem_score` | Fraction of subproblems solved across all problems (weight: 1.0) |
| `main_problem_score` | Fraction of main problems solved end-to-end (all subproblems correct) (weight: 0.0) |

### Changelog

#### v0.1.5 (Feb 17, 2026)

- Return `vf.UserMessage` types instead of dicts in `env_response` and `setup_state` to conform with verifiers custom message types

#### v0.1.4 (Jan 21, 2026)

- Move test execution to sandbox (with custom Docker image)
- Fix bug about skipped steps (should load ground truth code so that model can reference it in later steps)
- Fix bug where history is not accumulative (i.e. information from previous steps is included into the prompt template, not as conversation history)
- Align parsing logic with official SciCode implementation (ours was overly strict)
- Combine `validation` and `test` splits into a single dataset,  score using fraction of subproblems solved, and use `with_background=True` by default (matching [AA](https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology/intelligence-benchmarking))
- Integrate monitor rubric pattern
- More debug logging
