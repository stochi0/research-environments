    Decorator for async functions to handle OpenAI-style rate limiting with
    shared backoff coordination across concurrent tasks.

    Notes:
      - Preserves original function signature (wrapper simply forwards *args/**kwargs).
      - Uses a shared Event to temporarily pause new calls when any call hits a 429.
      - Backoff curve ~ 1.36787944**attempt with jitter (constant ~= 1 + 1/e).
      - The rate_limit_event must be created with .set() called (event starts "open").

    Args mirror the original inlined version.
