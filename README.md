A collection of environments maintained by the Prime Intellect Research Team. For community-contributed environments, check [prime-environments](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-environments).

## Installation

**Quick Installation (Recommended)**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/research-environments/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Manual Installation
</summary>

<br>

1. Install Git LFS

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git-lfs
```

2. Initialize Git LFS

```bash
git lfs install
```

3. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PrimeIntellect-ai/research-environments.git
cd research-environments
```

4. (Optional) Pull Git LFS

```bash
git lfs pull
```

5. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

6. Synchronize the environment

```bash
uv sync
```

7. Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

8. Install and authenticate with Prime CLI

```bash
uv tool install prime
prime config set-api-key <api-key>
```

</details>

## Creating environments

Create a new environment template

```bash
prime env init <your-env-name> 
```

This will create an environment in `environments/<your-env-name>`. Enter the project directory with

```bash
cd environments/<your-env-name>
```

Then, edit your environment by implementing the `load_environment` function. To test, install the environment as a local package (editable) and then run the `vf-eval` entrypoint.

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

```bash
uv run vf-eval <your-env-name>
```

Once you are done, push the environment to the registry.

```bash
prime env push
```

*Note: Set the Prime Intellect team ID (either via `prime config set-team-id` or `PRIME_TEAM_ID` environment variable) to push to the Prime Intellect organization.*

## Running tests

We test that each environment can be installed, loaded, and evaluated. To run the tests, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests
```

To run the tests across all CPU cores via the `pytest-xdist` plugin, run:

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto tests
```

To run tests for a specific environment, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_envs.py::test_env -k <environment-name>
```
