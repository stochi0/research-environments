## Repository Development Notes

Use this guidance when contributing to the `research-environments` repository itself.

- Always use `uv` to run Python commands
- During development, install environments (`/environments`) from the project's root directory using editable, local installs as `uv pip install -e ./environments/<env-name>`. DO NOT install from within the environment directories.
- To check an environment implementation, use `uv run vf-eval`. Usually, it is useful to start by running a single rollout with verbose logs. Once the environment runs smoothly, generate more samples, save them, and analyze the results.
```bash
# generate a single rollout in debug mode
uv run vf-eval --env <env-name> -d -v -n1 -r1

# generate multiple rollouts and save them
uv run vf-eval --env <env-name> -n5 -r3 -s
```
- After comphrehensive changes, check linting and styling for the environment you modified
```bash 
uv run ruff check ./environments/<env-name>
uv run ruff format --check /environments/<env-name>
```
- Always keep the environment's README up-to-date with any relevant changes.
- Shared utilities live in `src/research_environments/` and are part of the root `research-environments` package
- Environments depend on shared code by adding `research-environments` to dependencies
  and `research-environments = { path = "../..", editable = true }` to `[tool.uv.sources]`
- The root package is installed automatically when installing an environment that depends on it
